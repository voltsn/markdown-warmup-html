## A funny story
This happend when I was 14 years old. My parents left me home alone with my little sister who at the time was only 2. 
Shes was running around the house, doing what 2 year olds do, at some everything gets quite. 
Worried I start looking for her, I am calling her name but I get no response. At that point I am panicking a bit, suddenly I hear noise comming from underneath my desk.
I take look... There shes is... Looking me straight in the eyes... That's when she decided to take a number two... 

### TL;DR
I was babysitting my 2 yeard old sister, thought she got hurt, but was busy taking a number two underneath my desk.
