            <p>This happend when I was 14 years old. My parents left me home alone with my little sister who at the time was only 2</p>
            <p>Shes was running around the house, doing what 2 year olds do, at some everything gets quite. </p>
            <p>Worried I start looking for her, I am calling her name but I get no response. At that point I am panicking a bit, suddenly I hear noise comming from underneath my desk.</p>
            <p>I take look... There shes is... Looking me straight in the eyes... That's when she decided to take a number two... </p>
            <h3>TL;DR</h3>
            <p>I was babysitting my 2 yeard old sister, thought she got hurt, but was busy taking a number two underneath my desk. </p>
